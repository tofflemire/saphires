# SAPHIRES
SAPHIRES - Stellar Analysis in Python for HIgh REsolution Spectroscopy

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/183699708.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/183699708)


## Installation

`pip install saphires`

(Only compatible with Python 3.)  

## Description

This python package includes some common tools for the analysis of high resolution spectra 
that don't typically have easily accessible python versions.

It currently includes:

- Spectral-Line Broadening Functions

- TODCOR (Two-Dimensional Cross Correlation)

It will soon include the following tools:

- Fourier Cross Correlation


There is also a utilities module (utils) that has some generally useful functions:

- Air to vacuum wavelength conversions, and vice versa (vac2air, air2vac)

- Continuum normalization (cont_norm)

- With more to come...

## Documentation

See the [documentation](https://saphires.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for information on how to install and use saphires.



This code is actively being developed with the help of Danny Krolikowski, Natalie Gosnell, Emily Leiner, Victoria Catlett, and Miguel Gutierrez. Submit a github ticket if you have questions!
